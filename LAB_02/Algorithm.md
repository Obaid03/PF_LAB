# Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.
Ask the user to enter a number (N1)\
Ask the user to enter a number (N2)\
Set the remainder formula to (N2 divided by N1)\
Apply the remainder formula\
Check if the reaminder is equals to Zero(0) or one(1)\
If it is zero(0) display the user "It is a divisor" 
- set the modulus formula to (N1 mod 2)
- Apply the modulus formula 
- if the answer is zero(0) diplay the user "It is an even Number" 
- otherwise display  "It is an odd Number" 
    
Otherwise display the user " It is not a divisor" 

# Implement an algorithm where the user enters a number, and an appropriate month is displayed.
set 01 to "January"\
set 02 to "February"\
set 03 to "March"\
set 04 to "April"\
set 05 to "May"\
set 06 to "June"\
set 07 to "July"\
set 08 to "August"\
set 09 to "September"\
set 10 to "October"\
set 11 to "November"\
set 12 to "December"\
Ask the user to enter a two digit number from 01 to 12\
Display the corresponding month when number is entered

# Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)
Set Multiplication to (*)\
Set Divison to (/)\
Set Addition to (+)\
Set Subtraction to (-)\
Ask the user to enter a number (N1)\
Ask the user to enter a number (N2)\
Ask the user to enter type of operation\
Check if the type of operation is Multiplication then display the user (N1*N2)\
Check if the type of operation is Division then display the user (N1/N2)
Check if the type of operation is Addition then display the user (N1+N2)
Check if the type of operation is Subtraction then display the user (N1-N2)
