/* You are required to design a calculator utilizing an array. Take a string from the
user i.e. 20+10-30 and store it in an array. Traverse through the array, if there are
values stored them in some variable and if an operation comes perform the
necessary operation and if a null character comes display the result. If the null
character comes after the operator, the program should print an invalid
expression. (Note: Only do this for + and - operator) */
