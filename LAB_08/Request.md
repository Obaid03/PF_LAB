#Request for Lab Task Review

Dear Sir Monis,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that I have not been feeling well since last week, and with the mid-2 exams starting
on Monday, this week has been quite overwhelming with quizzes and assignments. I kindly request you to check my Lab-8 tasks along with the Lab-9 tasks.
I assure you that I will complete both labs immediately after the mid exams and will submit them before the next lab session.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
